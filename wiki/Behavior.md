# Behavior

This page documents user-visible runtime behavior of the dashboard and data pipeline.

## Map markers are triangles (not pinpoint dots)

To avoid implying “pinpoint precision” for geocoded incidents, the map does **not** draw a single exact dot.
Instead, each incident is rendered as a **small semi-transparent triangle** (Leaflet polygon) centered on the incident’s stored latitude/longitude.

- **Why triangles**: geocoding is an estimate; a small area communicates “general vicinity” better than a dot.
- **Deterministic rotation**: the triangle is rotated deterministically per incident so it doesn’t “wiggle” on refresh.

### Triangle size scales by geocode confidence

Triangle size is based on the incident’s stored geocoding metadata:

- **Smaller triangles**: validated intersection geocodes (ex: `geocode_quality = intersection-2`)
- **Larger triangles**: lower-confidence geocodes (ex: `fallback`, `city-only`, `cross-only`, `street-only`)

This makes uncertain placements visually less precise while keeping high-confidence placements tight.

## Colors represent severity (not agency)

The UI uses a **severity-first** color scheme so colors have consistent meaning across the sidebar and the map:

- **Red**: high severity (life safety / violence / weapons / major incidents)
- **Yellow**: medium severity (theft / hazards / non-injury accidents, etc.)
- **Blue**: low severity (follow-up / reports / citizen assistance, etc.)

### Where severity colors appear

- **Sidebar cards**: the left accent bar and the agency badge use severity colors
- **Map triangles**: triangle fill/stroke uses the same severity color as the sidebar

### Severity classification (keyword-based)

Severity is derived from the incident `description` using keyword matching.
Examples of intent:

- **High (red)**: medical emergencies, fires/smoke, assaults/battery, shots fired/weapons, hit-and-run, serious injury accidents
- **Medium (yellow)**: stolen vehicle/theft/burglary, loose livestock/road hazards, typical crashes/accidents
- **Low (blue)**: follow-up investigations, reports, citizen assists, property checks

## Geocoding is intersection-first and self-healing (no DB wipe required)

Incidents are geocoded using a validated street-segment strategy:

- With a named street and two cross streets, validate `street & cross1` and `street & cross2`, then map the midpoint of that bracketed segment.
- With one cross street, validate the named street and cross street as a real intersection.
- If the street field is empty or is not a road, validate `cross1 & cross2` as the real intersection.
- ArcGIS results are accepted as intersections only when the provider reports `StreetInt`, returns both requested road names, meets the confidence threshold, and falls inside the source boundary.
- If specific cross-street evidence cannot be validated, the incident stays in the list without a map marker; the app does not invent a city-center coordinate.

The app stores geocoding metadata on each incident:

- `geocode_source`: `arcgis` | `osm` | `unresolved`
- `geocode_quality`: `street-segment` | `intersection-2` | `street+cross` | `street-only` | `cross-only` | `unresolved`
- `geocode_query`: the provider query used (two queries separated by `||` for a validated segment)
- `geocoded_at`: when the geocode was produced (UTC)
- `geocode_version`: the validation algorithm version that produced the stored result

### Existing DB rows can improve over time

When an incident already exists, the app can **re-geocode** it when its result is low-quality or was created by an older geocoder version. This also replaces old coordinates that were incorrectly labeled as intersections.

This lets you keep your existing `caddo911.db` while improving “bad” points as new scrapes arrive.
