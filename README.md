Real-time incident tracker for Caddo Parish, Baton Rouge traffic incidents, and Lafayette traffic incidents with an interactive map and live/history views.

**Created by [Vincent Larkin](https://vincentlarkin.com)** | [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/vincentwlarkin) | [GitHub](https://github.com/vincentlarkin)

## What It Does

- **Scrapes** the official [Caddo 911 Active Events](https://ias.ecc.caddo911.com/All_ActiveEvents.aspx) feed, Baton Rouge's traffic incident feed, and Lafayette's traffic feed every cycle
- **Displays** incidents on an interactive dark-themed map with color-coded markers
- **Supports source tabs**: `All`, `Caddo`, `Baton Rouge`, and `Lafayette (Beta)` in both Live and History views
- **Groups incidents by source** in `All` mode (not interleaved)
- **Filters** by agency and urgency/severity
- **Caches** incidents to SQLite for live + historical views
- **Archives** older, inactive incidents to monthly archive databases
- **Geocodes** addresses using source-aware bounds for better placement
- **Serves** a single-page frontend from `public/` (Leaflet map + filters)

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open **http://localhost:3911** in your browser.

### Run Modes

This app supports multiple modes depending on what you want to do.

#### Web dashboard (collector + web UI)

```bash
python app.py
# or explicitly:
python app.py --mode serve
```

#### Event gather mode (collector only, no web UI)

```bash
python app.py --mode gather
```

#### Interactive gather mode (press `2` to start the web UI)

```bash
python app.py --mode interactive
```

While running interactive mode:
- Press `2` to start the web UI
- Press `q` to quit

#### Options

```bash
# scrape interval (seconds)
python app.py --mode gather --interval 60

# quiet console output (recommended for gather mode)
python app.py --mode gather --quiet
```

#### Maintenance commands

```bash
# re-geocode all incidents with the current validation algorithm
python app.py --regeocode

# archive old incidents to monthly DBs
python app.py --archive

# create a one-time DB backup snapshot (main + archive DBs)
python app.py --backup

# backup only the main DB
python app.py --backup --backup-main-only
```

### Environment (optional)

- `CADDO911_DB_PATH` (default: auto-detect `data/caddo911.db`, sibling `../data/caddo911.db`, `/data/caddo911.db`, then `caddo911.db`)
- `CADDO911_DATA_DIR` (optional data directory used during DB auto-detection)
- `CADDO911_ARCHIVE_DAYS` (default: `30`)
- `CADDO911_BACKUP_DIR` (default: `<db dir>/backups`)
- `CADDO911_BACKUP_RETENTION_WEEKS` (default: `5`, keep the most recent 5 weekly snapshots per DB)
- `CADDO911_AUTH_TOKEN` or `CADDO911_AUTH_USER` + `CADDO911_AUTH_PASS`
- `CADDO911_ENABLE_REFRESH_ENDPOINT` (set to `1` to enable `/api/refresh`)

Automatic schedules:
- Daily archive: `3:00 AM` Central (`--no-auto-archive` to disable)
- Weekly backup snapshot: `Sunday 11:30 PM` Central (`--no-auto-backup` to disable)

## How It Works

1. **Scraping**: Uses source adapters in `sources/` (`caddo` + `batonrouge` + `lafayette`) to fetch and normalize incidents into one shared data shape.
2. **Deduplication**: Each incident gets a source-aware hash based on source, agency, time, description, and location.
3. **Geocoding**: Validates actual road intersections from ArcGIS provider metadata. Two cross streets are treated as endpoints bracketing the named street, and their midpoint is used when both endpoints validate. Unverified provider guesses are not mapped.
4. **Storage**: Incidents stored in `caddo911.db` (SQLite) with source, timestamps, and active/inactive status.
5. **Archiving**: Inactive incidents older than `CADDO911_ARCHIVE_DAYS` move to `caddo911_archive_YYYY_MM.db`.
6. **Backup snapshots**: Weekly SQLite-consistent snapshots are written to `backups/` (configurable).
7. **Frontend**: Single-page app with Leaflet.js map, source tabs, and shared filters for Live + History views.

## Agency Labels

| Code | Agency |
|------|--------|
| CFD1-9 | Caddo Fire Districts |
| SFD | Shreveport Fire Department |
| SPD | Shreveport Police Department |
| CSO | Caddo Sheriff's Office |
| POLICE | Lafayette Police label |
| SHERIFF | Lafayette Sheriff label |
| FIRE | Lafayette Fire label |

## Data Sources

This app currently ingests from:

- Caddo Parish 911 Communications District public feed:  
  `https://ias.ecc.caddo911.com/All_ActiveEvents.aspx`
- City of Baton Rouge traffic incidents page:  
  `https://city.brla.gov/traffic/incidents.asp`
- Lafayette Parish traffic feed endpoint (beta integration):  
  `https://lafayette911.org/wp-json/traffic-feed/v1/data`

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app.py` | Flask server, scraper, scheduler |
| `sources/caddo.py` | Caddo source adapter |
| `sources/batonrouge.py` | Baton Rouge source adapter |
| `sources/lafayette.py` | Lafayette source adapter |
| `public/index.html` | Dashboard UI with map + filters |
| `public/styles.css` | Frontend styling |
| `public/images/` | Logos and agency icons |
| `caddo911.db` | SQLite database (auto-created) |
| `caddo911_archive_YYYY_MM.db` | Monthly archive databases (auto-created) |
| `backups/*.db` | Weekly backup snapshots (auto-created) |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |

## Tips

- **Geocoding improves over time**: The app stores a geocoder version with each result. Active rows made by an older algorithm are re-checked automatically (no DB wipe required); use `python app.py --regeocode` to refresh inactive rows in the main database.
- **Choose source scope**: Use `All`, `Caddo`, `Baton Rouge`, or `Lafayette (Beta)` to control which feed is visible.
- **Filter incidents**: Use filter buttons to focus on agency types and urgency/severity.
- **Historical view**: Switch to "History" tab and select a date to browse past incidents

## Monthly Reporting API

The app now exposes a monthly report endpoint that summarizes:

- the most common incident type for a month
- the densest hotspot for that type within a configurable radius (default `5` miles)

Example:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3911/api/reports/monthly?month=2026-02&radius_miles=5&source=all"
```

Example with your hosted domain:

```bash
curl "https://your-domain.example/api/reports/monthly?month=2026-02&radius_miles=5&source=caddo"
```

Response highlights:

- `totalIncidents`: all incidents seen in that month
- `topIncidentType.description`: most common call/incident description
- `topIncidentType.count`: how many times it occurred
- `topIncidentType.hotspot.incidentCount`: how many of that type fell inside the strongest radius cluster
- `topIncidentType.hotspot.center`: approximate center point for the hotspot
- `topIncidentType.hotspot.topLocations`: most common nearby street/intersection labels in that hotspot
